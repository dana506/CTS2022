Code Review and Refactoring 

Formating
* the code wasn't indented properly (proceed with indents)
* some curly brackets were added where they were missing
* the else clause from constructor was removed because of the exception in the if clause
* the use of proper, suggestive lowerCammelCase names

General Programming
* this keyword was added to differentiate the loanValue of the class and the parameter in the setter function
* string concatenation was removed and function was implemented using string builder

Meaningful names
* more specific attributes names
* more specific functions names

Comments
* remove commented code 

Enumeration
* account type values should be contained into an enumeration
* remove the accountType integer

Variables
* .0125 broker fee as a static final variable 
* 365 integer as a static final variable

Objects
* removed the unused temp variable
* removed the unnecessary Account variable and used accounts[i] instead

Validation
* parameters are positive for loan and monthly rate

Functions
* difference between interest and principal 
* account interest fee
* loan value with interest
* account final fee
* remove function print()

Exceptions
* custom exceptions were created and implemented 

Classes and Interfaces
* public class fields were made private and accessor methods are used instead
* created new interface for computing monthly rate and overwrote it in the Account class
