Code Review

Formating
* the code wasn't indented properly (proceed with indents)
* some curly brackets were added where they were missing
* the else clause from constructor was removed because of the exception in the if clause
* the use of proper, suggestive lowerCammelCase names

General Programming
* this keyword was added to differentiate the loanValue of the class and the parameter in the setter function
* string concatenation was removed and function was implemented using string builder
