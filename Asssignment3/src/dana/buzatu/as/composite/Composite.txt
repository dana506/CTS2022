Final Project: Android Application for weather prediction and forecasting

In my application, there is a hierarchical structure of various data files created by 
the user with the purpose of being used for weather forecasting data analysis. Therefore 
a composite pattern has been chosen due to its flexibility and being easily extensible.
We can easily integrate new leaf nodes without alterations.
On the other hand, it is difficult  to modify the general structure of the hierarchy.
