Final Project: Android Application for weather prediction and forecasting

The singleton pattern allows a class or an object to have a single instance.
A global variable will be used in order to manage the created instance in order to
prevent multiple instances to be active at the same time. 

I believe that this pattern could be an useful one regarding logging errors that
may occur from all the different parts of my application during debugging.

Its advantages are that the class can be instantiated only once with global access 
to that instance. Besides being easy to use, there is no need for synchronization
and we can use the principle of lazy instantiation. On the other hand, one disadvantage
may be that the singleton implementation does not follow the DRY principle.
