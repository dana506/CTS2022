Final Project: Android Application for weather prediction and forecasting

Multiple unique objects are managed using a collection, in this case a HashMap
for error log information regarding my app.
When creating a log instance, it is better to first check if the instance exists 
and then create a new one to store it in the HashMap. This is quite similar to
Singleton, it is easy to implement but, this time multiple variants of the same
class may be created. More than one instance of the singleton is stored in the
collection and this is rather a disadvantage.
