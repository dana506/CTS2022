Final Project: Android Application for weather prediction and forecasting

The decorator pattern can be used in my project for decorating a new list view element based
on a template first one and a different kind of user (administrator) based on anothe user model.

The advantages are being easy to implement, the capability to be add different functionalities
to the main concept and of course, the fact that there are no limits in the number of decorations.
But the decorator design pattern is only a wrapper to the initial object and could lead to a lot 
of similar objects with different behaviors.
